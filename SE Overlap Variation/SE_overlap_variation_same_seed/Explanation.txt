SE Overlap Variation – Same Seed Study

This folder contains microstructure simulations where the solid electrolyte (SE) particle overlap
is systematically varied from 0.60 to 0.95 while keeping the random seed constant.

Objective:
The purpose of this study is to analyze how increasing solid electrolyte particle overlap
affects microstructural connectivity and percolation behavior in solid-state battery systems.

Why Same Seed?
The same random seed is used for all overlap cases to ensure that the initial particle
distribution remains statistically identical. This allows us to isolate and study only the
effect of overlap variation without introducing randomness-related structural differences.

Overlap Range:
The following overlap values are considered:
0.60
0.65
0.70
0.75
0.80
0.85
0.90
0.95

Each subfolder (e.g., same_seed_0.60_SE_overlap) contains:
- Generated microstructure data
- Particle coordinate information
- Percolation analysis results
- Any processed or exported data related to that specific overlap value

Scientific Relevance:
Solid electrolyte particle overlap plays a critical role in determining:
- Ionic transport pathways
- Percolation probability
- Effective conductivity
- Microstructural connectivity

By varying overlap while keeping the seed constant, this dataset enables a controlled
comparative study of structural evolution and transport properties.

This folder is part of the larger project:
"Microstructure Modelling of Solid-State Batteries"
